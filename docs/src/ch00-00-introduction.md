# Introduction


I am glad that you decided to take this course! I believe the
tools that we will introduce will prove invaluable as you develop
your own skills as a researcher and data scientist. Many of these tools 
have been around since the advent of modern computing. They are tried and 
tested, and they are continue to improve as time goes on. While they can 
sometimes feel foreign and their interfaces may feel ancient, trust me when 
I say that there is good reason that they look and feel the way that they 
do. Don't be tempted to think that the flashiest tool is the best tool.


This course is actively developed on [GitHub][1] using the tools that we will
discuss. Don't worry if some things feel opaque at first. It takes time
to get a sense of these tools and ideas. As we go throught the course, 
things that at first seemed opaque will become clear. Sometimes we have 
to experience things without fully understanding them, gradually building 
context and experience as we go. And there will always be more to learn.


# Context


I believe it is important to consider this course and data science in
context. Data science is a broad term, and many people have many takes 
on what it means. For some, it is about data preprocessing, visualization, 
and summarization. For others, it is largely about machine learning models. 
Some people consider themselves more akin to statisticians than computer 
scientists. 


My opinion, and this is biased for sure, is that data science 
most closely associated with computer science. Sure, many of the models 
that we consider are statistical in nature, but the more often than not, 
the tools data scientists use are squarely in the wheelhouse of computing.
If much of the tools that we are using relate to computing, then we ought
to pay attention to what computer science gives us. Computer science has 
long been concerned with managing data and using it effectively. Data science
may be a fairly recent term, but many of the ideas in this field have been
considered by computer scientists.


One of the great things about PhD work is that you get to plot your own 
course with your studies. This is especially true with the Bredesen Center as
it is intended to be interdisciplinary. So let me encourage you to seek out
diverse perspectives across the University of Tennessee and Oak Ridge National
Lab. They are both great places to be.


When I studied at UT, I stradled the Math, Statistics, and Computer Science 
departments. If it is not already clear from above, I hold most strongly 
to the Computer Science department, but both the Math and Statistics departments
have their strengths. Feel free to ask me questions about my experience at UT. 
Though I will be biased, I may be able to help orient you as you seek out courses
and research during your time at UT. Fair warning, I will likely encourage you 
to take plenty of computer science courses.
