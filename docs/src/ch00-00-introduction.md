# Introduction


I am glad that you decided to take this course! I believe the
tools that we will introduce will prove invaluable as you develop
your own skills as a researcher and data scientist. Many of these tools 
have been around since the advent of modern computing. They are tried and 
tested, and they are continue to improve as time goes on. While they can 
sometimes feel foreign and their interfaces may feel ancient, trust me when 
I say that there is good reason that they look and feel the way that they 
do. Don't be tempted to think that the flashiest tool is the best tool.


This course is actively developed on [GitHub][1] using the tools that we will
discuss. Don't worry if some things feel opaque at first. It takes time
to get a sense of these tools and ideas. As we go throught the course, 
things that seemed opaque will become clear. Sometimes you have to experience
things without fully understanding them, gradually building context and
experience as we go.
