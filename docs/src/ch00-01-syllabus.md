### Course Description 

This course is an introduction to general data science skills 
not commonly covered in other courses. In particular, we will 
discuss handling data, best practices for coding, and how to 
operate in common computing environments like Linux workstations 
and shared computing clusters. You will learn communication and 
reproducibility fundamentals to enable your success in large 
collaborative data science projects.


### Assessment and Grading: 

Most course-related materials will be posted on Canvas. Your 
course grade will be evaluated based on your performance in the 
following areas below. Late assignments will have a 10% penalty 
per day. If you require extra time to complete an assignment 
(e.g. due to a paper deadline or other research need), notify 
the instructors at least one week in advance. 

```
Homework: 30% 
Projects: 70%
```

### Individual Project:

We will assign a mid-term project involving ingestion of raw data 
and basic data analysis. Code and a short report will be produced. 
Students will be judged on documentation, reproducibility, and 
functionality of their solution.

### Group Project:

We will split the class into groups of 3-5 individuals who will 
approach a more complex project involving multiple repositories and 
roles. Students will be expected to work with one another, contribute 
to each otherâ€™s code-bases, and communicate effectively in order to 
accomplish their task. At the end of the semester a presentation will 
be prepared by each group, outlining their approach and we will discuss 
what worked and did not work as a class.The grade system below will be 
used to determine your final grade. To minimize possible bias, no grades 
will be rounded and there will be no extra credit.
