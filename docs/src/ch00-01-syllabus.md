### Course Description 

This course is an introduction to general data science skills 
not commonly covered in other courses. In particular, we will 
discuss handling data, best practices for coding, and how to 
operate in common computing environments like Linux workstations 
and shared computing clusters. You will learn communication and 
reproducibility fundamentals to enable your success in large 
collaborative data science projects.


### Assessment and Grading: 

Most course-related materials will be posted on Canvas. Your 
course grade will be evaluated based on your performance in the 
following areas below. Late assignments will have a 10% penalty 
per day. If you require extra time to complete an assignment 
(e.g. due to a paper deadline or other research need), notify 
the instructors at least one week in advance. 

```
Homework: 30% 
Projects: 70%
```

### Individual Project:

We will assign a mid-term project involving ingestion of raw data 
and basic data analysis. Code and a short report will be produced. 
Students will be judged on documentation, reproducibility, and 
functionality of their solution.

### Group Project:

We will split the class into groups of 3-5 individuals who will 
approach a more complex project involving multiple repositories and 
roles. Students will be expected to work with one another, contribute 
to each other’s code-bases, and communicate effectively in order to 
accomplish their task. At the end of the semester a presentation will 
be prepared by each group, outlining their approach and we will discuss 
what worked and did not work as a class.The grade system below will be 
used to determine your final grade. To minimize possible bias, no grades 
will be rounded and there will be no extra credit.

### Grading

To minimize possible bias, no grades will be rounded and there will 
be no extra credit.


| Grade  | Minimum Percentage |
| :---:  | :----------------: |
| A      |  90                |
| B      |  80                |
| C      |  70                |
| D      |  60                |
| F      |  00                |


### Attendance and Participation

Because we will regularly be having group discussions and test material 
will be presented in class, attendance is expected. No make-up assessments 
can be scheduled for non-emergency absences. See the [university's policy][1]
on valid/excused absences.

### Academic Integrity: 

“An essential feature of the University of Tennessee, Knoxville is a 
commitment to maintaining an atmosphere of intellectual integrity and 
academic honesty. As a student of the university, I pledge that I will 
neither knowingly give nor receive any inappropriate assistance in 
academic work, thus affirming my own personal commitment to honor and 
integrity.” Cheating, plagiarism, or any other type of academic 
dishonesty will result in a failing grade.

### University Civility Statement 

Civility is genuine respect and regard for others: politeness, 
consideration, tact, good manners, graciousness, cordiality, affability, 
amiability and courteousness. Civility enhances academic freedom and 
integrity, and is a prerequisite to the free exchange of ideas and 
knowledge in the learning community. Our community consists of students, 
faculty, staff, alumni, and campus visitors. Community members affect 
each other’s well-being and have a shared interest in creating and 
sustaining an environment where all community members and their points 
of view are valued and respected. Affirming the value of each member of 
the university community, the campus asks that all its members adhere 
to the principles of civility and community adopted by the campus:
