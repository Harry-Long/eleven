# Visualization

Data visualization plays an important role in scientific computing. It is
often used in the exploratory data analysis phase at the beginning of a 
project, where we are trying to build some intuition about our data. It then 
often steers our experiments as we visualize the intermediate results of our 
models and experiments. and it is almost always included when we present our 
results in papers.
