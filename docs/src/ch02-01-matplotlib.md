# Matplotlib

[Matplotlib][1] is one of the most mature visualization libraries
in Python. It allows us to quickly create figures when we are
first exploring our data and models, and allows us to have a
lot of control over our final figures for publications.

Like many mature software projects, it can be a bit daunting 
at first. There are a couple ways to approach things with 
Matplotlib, through what is known as the state-machine interface
of [matplotlib.pyplot][2] and the object oriented approach. Depending 
on our needs, you might prefer one over the other. We will take 
a look at both of these approaches.
