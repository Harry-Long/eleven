# Getting Started with Python

We will be using Python throughout the course. Why Python and not
another language like Julia or R? While Julia and R have a lot to
bring to the table, Python has been a de facto choice for many 
data scientists. And for good reason, Python's ecosystem is mature;
there are countless libraries that you can use in your daily work.
Inevitably, we will introduce some of these libraries ourselves. 
Python is also not limited to data analysis. If ever you would 
like to expolore applications outside of data science, Python is 
not a bad initial choice.

### Anaconda

We will start by using [Anaconda][1], a distribution of Python 
including a package manager with many of the packages commonly 
used in data science, and a way to manage programming environments. 
While not the only way to get started with Python, this is one of the 
most common approaches. Many collaborators at ORNL will be familiar 
with Anaconda, and it is an easy way to quickly get people on the same 
page when setting up their compute environments.
