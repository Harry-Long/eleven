<p>Welcome to Data Science 511! This course is an introduction to the tools and
practices of data scientists. Our goal is to get you familiar with how work is
done in data science, at an individual level as well as in collaborative settings.
This is an interdisciplinary field that includes people from all sorts of
backgrounds and experience, but there are things that all data scientists share.
This course will give you experience in working as a data scientist, and will point
you to tools that you can use, regardless of where your research interests take you.</p>
<p>We will begin with work at an individual level, getting familiar with the tools that
each data scientist can use when working on a solo project. Gradually, we will expand 
our approach to show how those same tools can be used to collaborate with other individuals,
teams, and large organizations. As we go through the semester, we will find how each of
these tools benefit us, and how they can be combined in powerful ways.</p>
<p>As we said before, data scientists come from all sorts of backgrounds. This diversity is
a strength of data science and often leads to interesting projects and perspectives that
you may not be familiar with. Don’t be intimidated by not knowing everything. There will
always be elements of things that we do not know. Build up experience with the tools at
your disposal, and you will find yourself able to collaborate and learn as you go.</p>
<p><em>Todd Young</em></p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#introduction" id="introduction">Introduction</a></h1>
<p>I am glad that you decided to take this course! I believe the
tools that we will introduce will prove invaluable as you develop
your own skills as a researcher and data scientist. Many of these tools 
have been around since the advent of modern computing. They are tried and 
tested, and they are continue to improve as time goes on. While they can 
sometimes feel foreign and their interfaces may feel ancient, trust me when 
I say that there is good reason that they look and feel the way that they 
do. Don’t be tempted to think that the flashiest tool is the best tool.</p>
<p>This course is actively developed on <a href="https://github.com/yngtodd/eleven">GitHub</a> using the tools that we will
discuss. Don’t worry if some things feel opaque at first. It takes time
to get a sense of these tools and ideas. As we go throught the course, 
things that at first seemed opaque will become clear. Sometimes we have 
to experience things without fully understanding them, gradually building 
context and experience as we go. And there will always be more to learn.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#context" id="context">Context</a></h1>
<p>I believe it is important to consider this course and data science in
context. Data science is a broad term, and many people have many takes 
on what it means. For some, it is about data preprocessing, visualization, 
and summarization. For others, it is largely about machine learning models. 
Some people consider themselves more akin to statisticians or mathematicians,
others more closely align with computer scientists.</p>
<p>My opinion, and this is biased for sure, is that data science 
most closely associated with computer science. Sure, many of the models 
that we consider are statistical in nature, but the more often than not, 
the tools data scientists use are squarely in the wheelhouse of computing.
If much of the tools that we are using relate to computing, then we ought
to pay attention to what computer science gives us. Computer science has 
long been concerned with managing data and using it effectively. Data science
may be a fairly recent term, but many of the ideas in this field have been
considered by computer scientists.</p>
<p>One of the great things about PhD work is that you get to plot your own 
course with your studies. This is especially true with the Bredesen Center as
it is intended to be interdisciplinary. So let me encourage you to seek out
diverse perspectives across the University of Tennessee and Oak Ridge National
Lab. They are both great places to study and do research.</p>
<p>When I studied at UT, I stradled the Math, Statistics, and Computer Science 
departments. If it is not already clear from above, I hold most strongly 
to the Computer Science department, but both the Math and Statistics Departments
have their strengths. Feel free to ask me questions about my experience at UT. 
Though I will be biased, I may be able to help orient you as you seek out courses
and research during your time at UT. Fair warning, I will likely encourage you 
to take plenty of computer science courses.</p>

<h3><a class="header" href="#course-description" id="course-description">Course Description</a></h3>
<p>This course is an introduction to general data science skills 
not commonly covered in other courses. In particular, we will 
discuss handling data, best practices for coding, and how to 
operate in common computing environments like Linux workstations 
and shared computing clusters. You will learn communication and 
reproducibility fundamentals to enable your success in large 
collaborative data science projects.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#assessment-and-grading" id="assessment-and-grading">Assessment and Grading:</a></h3>
<p>Most course-related materials will be posted on Canvas. Your 
course grade will be evaluated based on your performance in the 
following areas below. Late assignments will have a 10% penalty 
per day. If you require extra time to complete an assignment 
(e.g. due to a paper deadline or other research need), notify 
the instructors at least one week in advance. </p>
<pre><code>Homework: 30% 
Projects: 70%
</code></pre>
<h3><a class="header" href="#individual-project" id="individual-project">Individual Project:</a></h3>
<p>We will assign a mid-term project involving ingestion of raw data 
and basic data analysis. Code and a short report will be produced. 
Students will be judged on documentation, reproducibility, and 
functionality of their solution.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#group-project" id="group-project">Group Project:</a></h3>
<p>We will split the class into groups of 3-5 individuals who will 
approach a more complex project involving multiple repositories and 
roles. Students will be expected to work with one another, contribute 
to each other’s code-bases, and communicate effectively in order to 
accomplish their task. At the end of the semester a presentation will 
be prepared by each group, outlining their approach and we will discuss 
what worked and did not work as a class.The grade system below will be 
used to determine your final grade. To minimize possible bias, no grades 
will be rounded and there will be no extra credit.</p>

<h1><a class="header" href="#getting-started-with-python" id="getting-started-with-python">Getting Started with Python</a></h1>
<p>We will be using Python throughout the course. Why Python and not
another language like Julia or R? While Julia and R have a lot to
bring to the table, Python has been a de facto choice for many 
data scientists. And for good reason, Python’s ecosystem is mature;
there are countless libraries that you can use in your daily work.
Inevitably, we will introduce some of these libraries ourselves. 
Python is also not limited to data analysis. If ever you would 
like to explore applications outside of data science, Python is 
not a bad initial choice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Side Note</em>:<br />
if you are interested other languages, you are in good
company. Jacob is a big fan of Haskell and Todd loves Rust and still
appreciates C. We can’t include all of the languages we care about in
this course, but if you would like to know how you can use another language
over the course of your PhD, let us know! We can get you connected with
people that would also like to use your language of choice (especially
if it is Haskell or Rust). There are people at the lab that use R,

<h2><a class="header" href="#anaconda" id="anaconda">Anaconda</a></h2>
<p>We will start by using <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual">Anaconda</a>, a distribution of Python 
including a package manager with many of the packages commonly 
used in data science, and a way to manage programming environments. 
While not the only way to get started with Python, this is one of the 
most common approaches. Many collaborators at ORNL will be familiar 
with Anaconda, and it is an easy way to quickly get people on the same 
page when setting up their compute environments.</p>
<h4><a class="header" href="#installation" id="installation">Installation</a></h4>
<p>As of Fall 2020, the Anaconda is distributing Python 3.8. Don’t worry if you
find that you need to use a different version of Python. Anaconda can help you
manage multiple versions of Python within <code>conda environments</code>. Just don’t use 
Python 2. It is no longer supported by the Python Foundation, the governing 
body of Python.</p>

<p><em>Side Note</em>:<br />
For much of this book we are assuming that you are using a Unix like operating
system (Linux, MacOS, BSD). If you are using Windows, please let us know! We
can help you sort out some potential issues you may have. For much of the 
computing at ORNL, particularly when it comes to the supercomputers, Linux 
is the default. We do not demand that you use a Unix like OS, but you may have
to do some extra leg work.</p>

<h4><a class="header" href="#graphical-installer" id="graphical-installer">Graphical Installer</a></h4>
<p>For a graphical installer of Python, follow the download instructions <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual">here</a>. </p>
<h4><a class="header" href="#command-line-installation" id="command-line-installation">Command Line Installation</a></h4>
<p>If you prefer to work on the command line, you can find various versions 
of bash install scripts in the <a href="https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/">Anaconda archive</a>. Make sure that you 
grab the appropriate 64 bit installer for you operating system in the archive,
then download it using wget:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/&lt;Filename&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>&lt;Filename&gt;</code> is the name of the bash script found in the archive. For
example, if you are on a 64 bit Linux system, use</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2020.07-Linux-x86_64.sh
</code></pre>
<p>Once you have that install script, follow the steps outlined after running the 
installer:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">bash &lt;Filename&gt;
</code></pre>
<h4><a class="header" href="#verifying-our-installation" id="verifying-our-installation">Verifying our Installation</a></h4>
<p>Once you have installed Anaconda, let’s check to see that everything is working 
well. Let’s start by checking where Python is installed:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">which python
</code></pre>
<p>This will give you a path to where Python is installed. For example, my Python is 
installed in the following path:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">which python
&gt;&gt;&gt; /home/yngtodd/.local/opt/anaconda3/bin/python
</code></pre>
<p>We will discuss paths and the Linux filesystem a bit later on. For now, Let’s make sure
that the path you get from <code>which python</code> includes <code>anaconda3/bin/python</code>. If instead you see
<code>/usr/bin/python</code>, then we need to do some debugging as you are using what is known as 
system Python instead of Anaconda.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Side Note</em>:<br />
You may wonder what <code>which</code> is. This is a Unix program that is installed in Unix-like
operating systems by default. It tells you the path to where any program you run on the 
command line lives. Knowing more about the command line environment will be useful for us,
but we need to get up and running with Python first! If you are curious and want to look 
further into this, try <code>man which</code> to see the manual page for <code>which</code> (<code>man</code> is another
default Unix program). What happens if you run <code>which which</code>?</p>

<h1><a class="header" href="#visualization" id="visualization">Visualization</a></h1>
<p>Data visualization plays an important role in scientific computing. It is
often used in the exploratory data analysis phase at the beginning of a 
project, where we are trying to build some intuition about our data. It then 
often steers our experiments as we visualize the intermediate results of our 
models and experiments. and it is almost always included when we present our 
results in papers.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#matplotlib" id="matplotlib">Matplotlib</a></h1>
<p><a href="https://matplotlib.org/">Matplotlib</a> is one of the most mature visualization libraries
in Python. It allows us to quickly create figures when we are
first exploring our data and models, and allows us to have a
lot of control over our final figures for publications.</p>
<p>Like many mature software projects, it can be a bit daunting 
to work with at first. There are a couple ways to approach things 
with Matplotlib, through what is known as the state-machine interface
of <a href="https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.html#module-matplotlib.pyplot">matplotlib.pyplot</a> and the object oriented approach. Depending 
on our needs, we might prefer one over the other. We will take 
a look at both of these approaches. </p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#key-components-of-a-figure" id="key-components-of-a-figure">Key Components of a Figure</a></h2>
<p>There are several components of a Matplotlib figure. Understanding 
how each of these fit together will give us better control over our
visualizations. This is important when we want to present our work 
in papers, but it will also help us debug things when the default 
settings for figures don’t quite come out right.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#figure" id="figure">Figure</a></h3>
<p>This is the entire figure object. It keeps track of all the figure’s 
<a href="https://matplotlib.org/api/axes_api.html#matplotlib.axes.Axes">Axes</a>, legends, titles, and the <a href="https://matplotlib.org/3.2.2/api/backend_bases_api.html#matplotlib.backend_bases.FigureCanvasBase">canvas</a> object. </p>

fig = plt.figure()
fig.suptitle('Empty Figure Without Axes')
plt.show()

<h3><a class="header" href="#axes" id="axes">Axes</a></h3>
<p><code>Axes</code> are an important part of Matplotlib’s interface. These are what
you would consider the “plot” of your figure, the area in the image
that contains your data. A figure can have many <code>Axes</code>, but each <code>Axes</code>
can only have one <code>Figure</code>. Data limits for the figure can be controlled 
through <code>Axes</code> with <code>axes.Axes.set_xlim()</code> and <code>axes.Axes.set_ylim()</code>. Axes 
also hold titles and labels for each for each axis. Axes contain either 
two or three <code>Axis</code> objects.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#axis" id="axis">Axis</a></h3>
<p>An <code>Axis</code> is acts as a scale delimeter for the <code>Axes</code>. They set the limits
of a figure and control the ticks of a plot.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#creating-figures" id="creating-figures">Creating Figures</a></h2>
<p>While we will take a closer look at this over the next sections of this 
chapter, there are a couple of things you want to keep in mind when 
working with Matplotlib.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#input-data" id="input-data">Input Data</a></h3>
<p>Matplotlib recommends using <a href="https://numpy.org/">Numpy</a> arrays as input types for figures.
You can often get away with using Python lists and <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a> dataframe
objects, but you might encounter some rough edges here and there when
using those object types.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#two-iterfaces" id="two-iterfaces">Two Iterfaces</a></h3>
<p>As mentioned above, there are two main interfaces for Matplotlib, the
state-machine interface and the object-oriented interface. In the next
section, we will cover each of these approaches and talk about when you
would want to use each.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#matplotlibs-state-machine-approach" id="matplotlibs-state-machine-approach">Matplotlib’s State-Machine Approach</a></h1>
<p>Matplotlib’s <code>matplotlib.pyplot</code> module is designed to feel like MATLAB.
Rather than explicitly creating figure objects, the <code>pyplot</code> module 
maintains state as soon as it is imported. If you come from a more 
object-oriented background, this may seem like a bit of magic. It can be
a bit difficult to know what Matplotlib is doing for you in the background,
but it does allow you to get up and running with fewer lines of code.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look of a simple example, plotting a single curve:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # immediately plt is keeping track of state

# first 10 squares
squares = [x**2 for x in range(11)]

plt.plot(squares)
plt.show()
</code></pre>

    <figcaption>
      Fig.1 - A simple curve of the first 10 squares.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
</html>
<p>This is about as simple as a Matplotlib figure can get. Given <code>x</code>, 
a Python list of the first 10 squares, Matplotlib gives us a line
plot. The <code>pyplot</code> module is inferring a lot here. Notice that we did
not specify our x and y axes. We didn’t even tell it Matplotlib that
we were looking to plot a curve here!</p>
<p>Also note that we never instantiated an object from the <code>pyplot</code> module.
Instead, we are calling the module directly. First, we feed our data
into <code>plt.plt(x)</code>, then we call <code>plt.show()</code> to render our figure. If we 
were to call <code>plt.show()</code> again without passing the data back into
<code>plt.plot()</code>, Matplotlib will not render the figure a second time. That 
is because Matploglib clears the state of our plot as soon as we call 
show`.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#adding-some-details" id="adding-some-details">Adding some Details</a></h2>
<p>While pyplot can infer a lot of the details for us, we will need to
handle axis labels and titles ourselves.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">plt.plot(squares)
plt.title('Squares Plot')
plt.ylabel(r'$X^{2}$')
plt.xlabel('X')
plt.show()
</code></pre>
